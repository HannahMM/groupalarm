Running and completed alerts as well as active and closed conferences
can be viewed, reviewed and ended in this menu “**Status**”.

As long as an alert is running or a conference is active, they are
displayed in the “Status” menu under “*running alerts*” or “*active
conferences*”.

All scheduled alerts/conferences are displayed under “*scheduled
alerts*”/“*scheduled conferences*”.

Once the alert or the conference has ended, an alert/conference protocol
is saved under “*completed alerts*”/“*closed conferences*”. The entire
alert process or conference is summarized in various reports which are
then made available for other applications.
