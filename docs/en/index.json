If predefined text was created, optionally use this as alert text by clicking or with “QuickEdit”. Texts from “Previous alerts” can be incorporated into the free text and reused with “QuickEdit”.\nCoordinates: Define, if you want to include coordinates in the alert message.\nAlert options: Define other settings for alert media, termination criteria, info transmission, etc. here.\nSchedule: Define, whether the alert should be sent immediately or scheduled for a future date.\nIf all required settings are done, the alert can be triggered by pressing the “Send Alert” button (button switched to red).\nIn addition to the alert trigger option directly from the GUI, eAlarm emergency also supports several remote triggers. Trigger the alert by SMS, call+ DTMF menu, direct dial and via a web link. Find more details about triggering alerts remotely in handout: “eAlarm emergency remote triggering”.\n(coming soon…)\n\nGeneral Changing the “Alert name”. Describe the alert in “Description” (optional). The alert creator is shown in “Creator”. The alert creation date can be found in “Date/time”.\n\nUnits See how many participants have been selected for the alert and being assigned to which units in “Unit”. Duplicate participants and such participants which cannot be alerted are not shown. Other units/participants can be added under [edit].\n\nText Before triggering the alert, it is possible to determine whether you want to select the predefined text (by clicking ) or create a new free text at this time. A predefined text can be incorporated and changed by clicking “QuickEdit”. In advantage, the dispatcher does not have to re-enter the entire text in “QuickEdit” but is able to use predefined text that can be changed to its needs.\n\nCoordinates Decide in the “Transmit coordinates” section, whether coordinates shall be transmitted or not.Enter the required address in “Address details”.\nAlternatively, enter the coordinates here:\nOnce an address was entered, it will be automatically converted into the WGS84 format.\n\nAlert options “Alert the following media”: Decide which resource has to be alerted and which not.\n“SMSprio”: Specify whether the alert should be sent over “SMSprio” or not. If “NO” is selected, the Flash SMS will not be sent. “Weekly planner”: (available in Media Priority List Plus module only)\n From participant data: the participants are alerted based on the predefined weekly planner\n Test (default): the predefined weekly planner (optional module) is not used for this option.\n  “Cancel”: Specify criteria to automatically terminate an alert here. Once one of the defined termination criteria is achieved during the alert process, the alert is being terminated.\n Termination due to x% of participants sending a positive acknowledgement\n Termination due to x participants sending a positive acknowledgement\n Termination x minutes after the alert was triggered\n  “Info transmission”: Define the people who should receive a specific document by e-mail/fax. In this section, it is also defineable which e-mail address, fax and/or mobile number is used for sending a regular summary about the alert status.\nComment: Regular summaries regarding an ongoing alert can also be sent.\n\nSchedule eAlarm is generally configured for an alert to be triggered directly. You can also schedule an alert to be triggered under scheduling options (“Send at this date”) by defining which day and at what time the alert should be triggered. For instance, these kinds of “scheduled” alerts can be used for test alerts, as they can be planned relatively easily in advance. Scheduled alerts can be viewed and deleted in the “Status” menu.\n"

	"content": "If an alert was triggered, the “Alert feedback” screen appears. All recipients to whom an alert was sent, are included in the feedback list. Follow the alert process in real-time here.\nThe participant responses can be viewed immediately at the feedback view and are updated on an ongoing basis. The dialogue window (“red box”) displays a graphical overview of the analysed acknowledgements. This overview shows the amount of participants with a specific status. Positive, negative and invalid acknowledgements are included in the list. Alerted stuff must acknowledge the alert with the predefined syntax so that the answers can be analysed. The syntax stipulates that an acknowledgement must start with one of the two keywords “Ja” or “Nein”, “OK” or “NOK” or “Oui”/“Non”, “Si”/“No”, “Yes”/“No”. If an additional text is sent, it must be separated from the keyword with a space (a comma or a full stop after the keyword cannot be evaluated).\nYES NO Yes I will be there in 20 min. No I won`t make it Yes I`ll be there No I won`t make it OK NOK OK I will be there in 20 min NOK I won`t make it OK I`ll be there NOK I can`t come\nExample of invalid answers:\n It\u0026rsquo;s OK, I\u0026rsquo;ll be there (incorrect keyword)\n Yes, in 15 min. (keyword separated by comma)\n  If eAlarm emergency cannot evaluate the responses due to incorrect syntax, the feedback recipient is assigned the status “Invalid” and the entire answer SMS is shown in the result column. The feedback recipient can manually set the “Result” to “Yes” or “No” based on the text by selecting the green tick or the red cross . If the recipient manually sets the participant to “Yes” for example, he is displayed in eAlarm as follows. The original text in the result is overwritten with the information on the manual status change.\nThe alert feedback uses a bar diagram to show the progress of participant acknowledgement. You can see at a glance the relative percentage of recipients who have given a positive or negative answer and the number of participants that have not yet acknowledged the alert.\nThe list of alert details shows when the alert was scheduled and started, as well as for how long the alert has been running. The traffic light indicates when the limit of the successful alert has been reached. When the traffic light switches from red to orange, a predefined number of participants have already acknowledged the alert positively. If the traffic light switches to green, the predefined number of positive answers required in the registry has been reached and you can end the alert.\nOnce the eAlarm emergency session has come to an end, you must log out of the application. Log out by clicking Logout on the tab “Session” tab.\n"

What alerting scenarios do you expect and what is the following course of events? Which User should get administrative rights, who should be allowed to alert, mutate, administrate?  In eAlarm emergency, your company structure is represented by so called \u0026lsquo;Roots\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Groups\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Participants\u0026rsquo;. which are hierarchically orderd and freely configurable.\n Creation of the higher-level roots for high ranking units, such as divisions or corporate departments\n Creation of groups, which are sub-categories of the roots. A root can have multiple groups and one group can be assigned to multiple roots or even other groups. Groups may represent different teams or operational units.\n Create and add concerning participants with all necessary information. Participants can belong to more than one group and/or root.\n  You can easily modify and amend your structure at all times.
