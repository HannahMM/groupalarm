	"content": "Goal is to create the alert trigger to be as simple and clear as possible. As a result, the alert organisation should also have a simple structure in order to ensure that the alert can be triggered as efficiently as possible in an emergency. Meaning the alert structure does not absolutely have to follow the organisational structure, but can be chosen according to the alert type or other criteria. The following section describes the “Organisational chart/Tree view”, “Participant list” and “Texts” functions in detail.\n"

	"content": " Table of Contents  Creating a new alert template\n Copying alert templates\n  Manage alert templates Alert templates are predefined alerts, i.e. the participant group and the possible alert texts are already predefined. In the event of an emergency, the predefined alert template can be triggered and the defined alert participants are sent the alert text via the respective media.\nThere are different ways to create an alert template: \nCreate a new alert template After you click the button in the “Manage alert templates” sub-menu, you are taken to previously seen screens. A template is created here which contains a trigger code, an authorised initiator, an alert name, a description and a text.\nAlert templates are saved under a freely definable name and given a customer-specific trigger code that is particularly important for remote triggering.\nOne text can be defined as the default from among all of the texts available; the others are displayed as alternative texts. Using the Radio button , the user can decide on a default text which can also be entered as a free text. The user ticks the checkboxes to select the alternative texts that shall be on the short list when an alert is triggered:\nIn the example above, the “*Dies ist ein TEST*” text is defined as the default text. Six alternative texts are selected at the same time. If you now want to trigger this alert template, you will see six texts that can be selected under the defined texts and the preselected text “*Dies ist ein TEST*”:\nIf the alert is triggered without changes, the alert is sent to the participants with the “Dies ist ein TEST” text. It is possible to edit the text (by pressing the *[QuickEdit]* button), select a defined text from the preselected texts or write a new text by clicking the Radio button next to the free text.Users with the “*E-Mail/Fax*” module enabled, which allows alerts to be sent to the e-mail and fax target media, can attach PDF documents to the text message. This means that, in the event of an alert, additional detailed information can be sent to fax and e-mail recipients as an attachment, if required. The corresponding links are available under the text fields. One document can be attached for each language. The user can define the number of text fields by enabling the “Show Languages” function in the Registry under Admin.\nThere are three termination criteria available for the alert in the “Alert options” sub-menu: after X% positive acknowledgements, i.e. yes answers, after X positive acknowledgements and X minutes after alert was started. The template can be locked via the icon. All of the alert templates created are saved and listed in a table under “Manage alert templates”.\nThis prevents an unauthorised person from editing or deleting the template. The alert can still be triggered. Only the author or super user can unlock the template.\n\nCopying alert templates You can easily copy existing alert templates. During the copying process, all of the data sets are also copied. To do this, click the Copy icon. Once you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of your alert template is created. The system names it “copy 1”.\n"

You can create and add new scenarios, alert templates, conference templates, Folders (Groups), schedules and/or users (subscribers).\n\nRoots To create a new root, enter the name of the new root in the input field and confirm by clicking the “Create” button. The created root is listed immediately in the display field. If the name chosen is already assigned, a warning message appears indicating this. You can add a name, contact and addresses to the newly created root by clicking the edit icon .\n\nGroup A new group can be created via the right-hand display window. Select a “New folder” for the group from the available selection options, enter the name of the group and confirm creation of the new group by pressing the “Enter” button. Once the group has been created, it is listed in the lower display field. It is also possible to edit the new group further via the edit icon and, as with the root, add detailed information such as name, contact and address. Although the delete function permanently deletes the created groups, the participants are retained and only the assignment to this group is eliminated.\n\nSubscriber Similar to groups, new participants can also be created using the “New user” command in the selection options.\nOnce the roots, groups and participants are entered, they must be organised into a specific structure. The hierarchical structure of the various organisational units is crucial for the alert.\nA root represents the highest hierarchical level that one or more groups can be assigned to. The group itself can also, in turn, contain one or more groups. One or more participants can be assigned to a group. A group and a participant can also be present multiple times in the organisational structure. The group and the participant can be assigned to a root/group using the drag \u0026amp; drop method.\nThe key icon can be used to assign access rights for the roots and groups. The delete function can be used to remove the created roots, groups and participants again.\n"

This way, if an alert has not ended after a certain, predefined amount of time, the next alert/conference template is triggered automatically. This allows automatic alert escalations to be predefined, which otherwise would have to be done manually.\nAlert templates are created in the first step (see previous chapter “Manage alert templates”). Once the alert templates (or conference templates) have been made, a scenario can be created. The scenarios are saved under a freely definable name and given a customer-specific trigger code that is particularly important for remote triggering.\nClick on “Manage alert scenarios”. Create a new scenario ( ) or manage an existing scenario by clicking on the blue edit icon.\nIn this example, we are selecting a new scenario. You are taken directly to the “General” tab.\n\nGeneral A trigger code appears at the top of the screen. Either leave it as it is or change it to any another code. Give the script a name and describe it in more detail if you wish.\n\nTemplate assignement You can add any templates that are available under “Attributable templates”.\nSelect one or several templates you require and then click on “add”.\nAs soon as you have added a number of templates, they will be listed and displayed in a grey frame. The first template always starts at 0 time (can be overridden). You can move the individual templates using drag \u0026amp; drop and in this way change their sequence. This is also possible under “*Simulation view Timeline*”. You can also set the time delay in the same way. Click on “save scenario” to save your changes.\n\nTexts When making a change, you can set a global freely definable text. Or, you can also choose the text from each template.\n\nCopy scenario You can easily copy an existing scenario. During the copying process, all of the data sets are also copied. To do this, click the copy icon.\nOnce you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of the scenario is created. The system names it “copy 1”.\n\nLock scenario The scenario can be locked via the icon.

The optional fields can be created so that they apply to all accounts in the “Data fields” menu under ADMIN.\n Alert medium  The alert media are defined in the alert medium section by selecting the alert medium in the drop-down menu and completing the respective number (or address). The alert media must be defined under ADMIN during first-time entry. The system conducts a minimum plausibility check which verifies the permissible formats. After being successfully checked, the alert medium can be added with the respective icon. Every medium gets a standard designation. Media that are classified as “private” are rendered unidentifiable. This privacy functionality must be explicitly enabled under Admin in the registry (“*Privacy Flag*”). [The various alert media are listed in the order in which they were entered. Based on this order, an alert is raised by first alerting the top alert medium and the alert is then forwarded to the next medium. The alert order can be flexibly changed by clicking an alert medium and moving it up or down via the drag \u0026amp; drop method. The active alert media is identified by a checkmark. If you want to set the status of an alert medium to “inactive”, remove the checkmark and the medium is displayed in grey: .\nIn this case, this alert medium is no longer included in the alert. If you want a parallel alert, i.e. all alert media of a participant are alerted simultaneously, set the checkmark in the “*Parallel alert*Bold Text” field: .\nIMPORTANT: when entering a new number, e-mail address, etc., you have to click “add”! Once you have added it successfully, you still have to set a checkmark for the alert medium. To edit the alert medium, click the edit icon ; To delete the alert medium, click the delete icon .\n\nCopying subscribers You can easily copy existing participants. When doing this, all data sets are also copied. To copy participants, click the copy icon.\nOnce you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of the participant is created. The system names it “copy 1”.\n\nSubscribers in groups You can assign the groups directly from the subscriber level. The groups can be assigned directly when changing the participants. There is a “*Groups*” tab for this purpose that shows all the groups available to this participant. On the left, you can see all the available and assignable groups, on the right, all the already assigned groups, which can be filed away again.\nClick on the tab “Mutation”.\nThen on “List of subscribers”.\nSelect a subscriber by clicking on the blue edit button .\nThen click on “Groups”.\nOn the left, you can see the groups that are available, and on the right, the group in which the participant is already a member.\nYou can select and subsequently “select” a group.

The created texts can be listened to via voice output, changed and deleted. The navigation buttons can be used to change the order of the created texts.\nAn alert/message can contain 160 characters. There are approximately ten characters in the GSM alphabet that need two characters, although only one is displayed. This applies to the following special characters: *€ { } [ ~ ] \\* as well as a page break and an ESC\nThe eAlarm counter does not take this into consideration and counts every stroke regardless of whether it needs one or two characters in the GSM alphabet. This can result in a discrepancy between the display and the actual dispatch. We recommend using the characters mentioned above only sporadically. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that they count for two characters. The counter in eAlarm cannot be adjusted, because the same alert text is also used for pagers, e-mail and fax messages for which the GSM alphabet is not relevant.\nPlease pay attention to the information in the lower area of the text editor:\n a time stamp with the format 03Apr2135 (for 3.4. 9:35 p.m.) is inserted into the message text using the placeholder *###dat###*\n A time stamp in the \u0026lsquo;Date-Time-Group\u0026rsquo; format, 032135Apr04 (for 3.4.2004 9:35 p.m.), is inserted into the message text using the placeholder *###dtg###*\n The placeholder *!name!* is replaced by the name of the participant upon dispatch. This makes it possible to use a personal greeting.\n The placeholder *###onum###* communicates the initiator\u0026rsquo;s telephone number to the recipient when an alert is triggered by voice call.\n  \nVoiceoutput option for alert texts You can listen to every text that you have created via the Language menu *[Language menu]*.
