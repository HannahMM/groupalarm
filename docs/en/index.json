If predefined text was created, optionally use this as alert text by clicking or with “QuickEdit”. Texts from “Previous alerts” can be incorporated into the free text and reused with “QuickEdit”.\nCoordinates: Define, if you want to include coordinates in the alert message.\nAlert options: Define other settings for alert media, termination criteria, info transmission, etc. here.\nSchedule: Define, whether the alert should be sent immediately or scheduled for a future date.\nIf all required settings are done, the alert can be triggered by pressing the “Send Alert” button (button switched to red).\nIn addition to the alert trigger option directly from the GUI, eAlarm emergency also supports several remote triggers. Trigger the alert by SMS, call+ DTMF menu, direct dial and via a web link. Find more details about triggering alerts remotely in handout: “eAlarm emergency remote triggering”.\n(coming soon…)\n\nGeneral Changing the “Alert name”. Describe the alert in “Description” (optional). The alert creator is shown in “Creator”. The alert creation date can be found in “Date/time”.\n\nUnits See how many participants have been selected for the alert and being assigned to which units in “Unit”. Duplicate participants and such participants which cannot be alerted are not shown. Other units/participants can be added under [edit].\n\nText Before triggering the alert, it is possible to determine whether you want to select the predefined text (by clicking ) or create a new free text at this time. A predefined text can be incorporated and changed by clicking “QuickEdit”. In advantage, the dispatcher does not have to re-enter the entire text in “QuickEdit” but is able to use predefined text that can be changed to its needs.\n\nCoordinates Decide in the “Transmit coordinates” section, whether coordinates shall be transmitted or not.Enter the required address in “Address details”.\nAlternatively, enter the coordinates here:\nOnce an address was entered, it will be automatically converted into the WGS84 format.\n\nAlert options “Alert the following media”: Decide which resource has to be alerted and which not.\n“SMSprio”: Specify whether the alert should be sent over “SMSprio” or not. If “NO” is selected, the Flash SMS will not be sent. “Weekly planner”: (available in Media Priority List Plus module only)\n From participant data: the participants are alerted based on the predefined weekly planner\n Test (default): the predefined weekly planner (optional module) is not used for this option.\n  “Cancel”: Specify criteria to automatically terminate an alert here. Once one of the defined termination criteria is achieved during the alert process, the alert is being terminated.\n Termination due to x% of participants sending a positive acknowledgement\n Termination due to x participants sending a positive acknowledgement\n Termination x minutes after the alert was triggered\n  “Info transmission”: Define the people who should receive a specific document by e-mail/fax. In this section, it is also defineable which e-mail address, fax and/or mobile number is used for sending a regular summary about the alert status.\nComment: Regular summaries regarding an ongoing alert can also be sent.\n\nSchedule eAlarm is generally configured for an alert to be triggered directly. You can also schedule an alert to be triggered under scheduling options (“Send at this date”) by defining which day and at what time the alert should be triggered. For instance, these kinds of “scheduled” alerts can be used for test alerts, as they can be planned relatively easily in advance. Scheduled alerts can be viewed and deleted in the “Status” menu.\n"

Positive, negative and invalid acknowledgements are included in the list. Alerted stuff must acknowledge the alert with the predefined syntax so that the answers can be analysed. The syntax stipulates that an acknowledgement must start with one of the two keywords “Ja” or “Nein”, “OK” or “NOK” or “Oui”/“Non”, “Si”/“No”, “Yes”/“No”.

If the recipient manually sets the participant to “Yes” for example, he is displayed in eAlarm as follows.

You can see at a glance the relative percentage of recipients who have given a positive or negative answer and the number of participants that have not yet acknowledged the alert.\nThe list of alert details shows when the alert was scheduled and started, as well as for how long the alert has been running. The traffic light indicates when the limit of the successful alert has been reached. When the traffic light switches from red to orange, a predefined number of participants have already acknowledged the alert positively.

	"content": " Table of Contents  Creating a new alert template\n Copying alert templates\n  Manage alert templates Alert templates are predefined alerts, i.e. the participant group and the possible alert texts are already predefined. In the event of an emergency, the predefined alert template can be triggered and the defined alert participants are sent the alert text via the respective media.\nThere are different ways to create an alert template: \nCreate a new alert template After you click the button in the “Manage alert templates” sub-menu, you are taken to previously seen screens. A template is created here which contains a trigger code, an authorised initiator, an alert name, a description and a text.\nAlert templates are saved under a freely definable name and given a customer-specific trigger code that is particularly important for remote triggering.\nOne text can be defined as the default from among all of the texts available; the others are displayed as alternative texts. Using the Radio button , the user can decide on a default text which can also be entered as a free text. The user ticks the checkboxes to select the alternative texts that shall be on the short list when an alert is triggered:\nIn the example above, the “*Dies ist ein TEST*” text is defined as the default text. Six alternative texts are selected at the same time. If you now want to trigger this alert template, you will see six texts that can be selected under the defined texts and the preselected text “*Dies ist ein TEST*”:\nIf the alert is triggered without changes, the alert is sent to the participants with the “Dies ist ein TEST” text. It is possible to edit the text (by pressing the *[QuickEdit]* button), select a defined text from the preselected texts or write a new text by clicking the Radio button next to the free text.Users with the “*E-Mail/Fax*” module enabled, which allows alerts to be sent to the e-mail and fax target media, can attach PDF documents to the text message. This means that, in the event of an alert, additional detailed information can be sent to fax and e-mail recipients as an attachment, if required. The corresponding links are available under the text fields. One document can be attached for each language. The user can define the number of text fields by enabling the “Show Languages” function in the Registry under Admin.\nThere are three termination criteria available for the alert in the “Alert options” sub-menu: after X% positive acknowledgements, i.e. yes answers, after X positive acknowledgements and X minutes after alert was started. The template can be locked via the icon. All of the alert templates created are saved and listed in a table under “Manage alert templates”.\nThis prevents an unauthorised person from editing or deleting the template. The alert can still be triggered. Only the author or super user can unlock the template.\n\nCopying alert templates You can easily copy existing alert templates. During the copying process, all of the data sets are also copied. To do this, click the Copy icon. Once you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of your alert template is created. The system names it “copy 1”.\n"

The hierarchical structure of the various organisational units is crucial for the alert.\nA root represents the highest hierarchical level that one or more groups can be assigned to. The group itself can also, in turn, contain one or more groups. One or more participants can be assigned to a group. A group and a participant can also be present multiple times in the organisational structure. The group and the participant can be assigned to a root/group using the drag \u0026amp; drop method.\nThe key icon can be used to assign access rights for the roots and groups.

The table shows the following from left to right:\n Alert name (the triggered alert)\n Description (additional alert description)\n Dispatcher (who triggered the alert?)\n Scheduled (when was the alert scheduled?)\n Started (when did the alert start?)\n Closed (when did the alert end?)\n Function (available functions, reports and logs for the respective alert)\n  The most important functions are: {.mediacenter width=\u0026ldquo;200\u0026rdquo;}](../pdf_wichtigste_funktionen_1_en.png_en_ea_abgeschlossene-alarme.en.md \u0026ldquo;en:pdf_wichtigste_funktionen_1_en.png\u0026rdquo;) 1. PDF Alert report In the first section of the protocol, you will see the alert name with the exact dates and times of the scheduled, started, ended and closed alerts. The second part displays all units alerted. The number of alerted group participants as well as how many of them were alerted is displayed as bracket note. Third section: The alert text is listed in all available languages. The fourth section shows alert Options.\n Alert : ALL, as long as no restrictions have been imposed, otherwise the individual media are listed\n SMS: SMSprio or normal SMS\n Escalation levels\n Termination criteria if any have been defined\n Protocol recipients if e-mail addresses or fax numbers were entered\n  The summary and thus the progress of the alert are provided in the fifth section. It is a detailed statistic. Change the basic setting and (for instance), set positive acknowledgements to 80%. In the figure below, one person was alerted who then acknowledged with “Yes”. The acknowledgement is therefore shown in green with 100%. An overview of the participants and their stati is presented in the sixth section. The seventh section of the protocol shows a detailed summary of the dispatch and traffic volume. 2. PDF Alert log\nDetailed overview of the individually alerted participants, which shows who was alerted and in what manner, which rescource was used and when this alert was triggered (incl. the related time stamps). The various stati and symbols are explained in the legend. 3. PDF view of the costs – cost analysis for the respective alert 4.

This, however, is not possible once the conference is triggered, e.g. by weblink.\n First Responder” conference: all of the participants included in the conference template are called. The conference, however, only takes place with the first person to accept the call. All other participants receive a cancellation notice.\n  Conference templates are saved under a freely definable name and given a customer-specific trigger code that is particularly important for remote triggering.\nNOTE The trigger code is all that is required to trigger a conference template, because this template does not need alert texts.\nIMPORTANT The trigger codes for each unit are independent of one another, i.e. trigger code 1 can occur up to three times: once for an alert template, once for a scenario and once for a conference template. The code only has to be unique within the same unit type which is also continuously checked by eAlarm emergency. The created conference templates are saved and listed in a table.\nThe template can be locked via the icon. This prevents an unauthorised person from editing or deleting the template. The conference can still be initiated. Only the author or super user can unlock the template.\n\nCopy conference templates You can easily copy existing conference templates. During the copying process, all of the data sets are also copied. To do this, click the Copy icon. Once you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of your alert template is created. The system names it “copy 1”. "

The created texts can be listened to via voice output, changed and deleted. The navigation buttons can be used to change the order of the created texts.\nAn alert/message can contain 160 characters. There are approximately ten characters in the GSM alphabet that need two characters, although only one is displayed. This applies to the following special characters: *€ { } [ ~ ] \\* as well as a page break and an ESC\nThe eAlarm counter does not take this into consideration and counts every stroke regardless of whether it needs one or two characters in the GSM alphabet. This can result in a discrepancy between the display and the actual dispatch. We recommend using the characters mentioned above only sporadically.

In eAlarm emergency, your company structure is represented by so called \u0026lsquo;Roots\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Groups\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Participants\u0026rsquo;. which are hierarchically orderd and freely configurable.\n Creation of the higher-level roots for high ranking units, such as divisions or corporate departments\n Creation of groups, which are sub-categories of the roots. A root can have multiple groups and one group can be assigned to multiple roots or even other groups. Groups may represent different teams or operational units.\n Create and add concerning participants with all necessary information.
