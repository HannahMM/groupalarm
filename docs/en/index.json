If predefined text was created, optionally use this as alert text by clicking or with “QuickEdit”. Texts from “Previous alerts” can be incorporated into the free text and reused with “QuickEdit”.\nCoordinates: Define, if you want to include coordinates in the alert message.\nAlert options: Define other settings for alert media, termination criteria, info transmission, etc. here.\nSchedule: Define, whether the alert should be sent immediately or scheduled for a future date.\nIf all required settings are done, the alert can be triggered by pressing the “Send Alert” button (button switched to red).\nIn addition to the alert trigger option directly from the GUI, eAlarm emergency also supports several remote triggers. Trigger the alert by SMS, call+ DTMF menu, direct dial and via a web link. Find more details about triggering alerts remotely in handout: “eAlarm emergency remote triggering”.\n(coming soon…)\n\nGeneral Changing the “Alert name”. Describe the alert in “Description” (optional). The alert creator is shown in “Creator”. The alert creation date can be found in “Date/time”.\n\nUnits See how many participants have been selected for the alert and being assigned to which units in “Unit”. Duplicate participants and such participants which cannot be alerted are not shown. Other units/participants can be added under [edit].\n\nText Before triggering the alert, it is possible to determine whether you want to select the predefined text (by clicking ) or create a new free text at this time. A predefined text can be incorporated and changed by clicking “QuickEdit”. In advantage, the dispatcher does not have to re-enter the entire text in “QuickEdit” but is able to use predefined text that can be changed to its needs.\n\nCoordinates Decide in the “Transmit coordinates” section, whether coordinates shall be transmitted or not.Enter the required address in “Address details”.\nAlternatively, enter the coordinates here:\nOnce an address was entered, it will be automatically converted into the WGS84 format.\n\nAlert options “Alert the following media”: Decide which resource has to be alerted and which not.\n“SMSprio”: Specify whether the alert should be sent over “SMSprio” or not. If “NO” is selected, the Flash SMS will not be sent. “Weekly planner”: (available in Media Priority List Plus module only)\n From participant data: the participants are alerted based on the predefined weekly planner\n Test (default): the predefined weekly planner (optional module) is not used for this option.\n  “Cancel”: Specify criteria to automatically terminate an alert here. Once one of the defined termination criteria is achieved during the alert process, the alert is being terminated.\n Termination due to x% of participants sending a positive acknowledgement\n Termination due to x participants sending a positive acknowledgement\n Termination x minutes after the alert was triggered\n  “Info transmission”: Define the people who should receive a specific document by e-mail/fax. In this section, it is also defineable which e-mail address, fax and/or mobile number is used for sending a regular summary about the alert status.\nComment: Regular summaries regarding an ongoing alert can also be sent.\n\nSchedule eAlarm is generally configured for an alert to be triggered directly. You can also schedule an alert to be triggered under scheduling options (“Send at this date”) by defining which day and at what time the alert should be triggered. For instance, these kinds of “scheduled” alerts can be used for test alerts, as they can be planned relatively easily in advance. Scheduled alerts can be viewed and deleted in the “Status” menu.\n"

	"content": "Goal is to create the alert trigger to be as simple and clear as possible. As a result, the alert organisation should also have a simple structure in order to ensure that the alert can be triggered as efficiently as possible in an emergency. Meaning the alert structure does not absolutely have to follow the organisational structure, but can be chosen according to the alert type or other criteria. The following section describes the “Organisational chart/Tree view”, “Participant list” and “Texts” functions in detail.\n"

The created root is listed immediately in the display field. If the name chosen is already assigned, a warning message appears indicating this. You can add a name, contact and addresses to the newly created root by clicking the edit icon .\n\nGroup A new group can be created via the right-hand display window. Select a “New folder” for the group from the available selection options, enter the name of the group and confirm creation of the new group by pressing the “Enter” button. Once the group has been created, it is listed in the lower display field. It is also possible to edit the new group further via the edit icon and, as with the root, add detailed information such as name, contact and address. Although the delete function permanently deletes the created groups, the participants are retained and only the assignment to this group is eliminated.\n\nSubscriber Similar to groups, new participants can also be created using the “New user” command in the selection options.\nOnce the roots, groups and participants are entered, they must be organised into a specific structure. The hierarchical structure of the various organisational units is crucial for the alert.\nA root represents the highest hierarchical level that one or more groups can be assigned to. The group itself can also, in turn, contain one or more groups. One or more participants can be assigned to a group. A group and a participant can also be present multiple times in the organisational structure. The group and the participant can be assigned to a root/group using the drag \u0026amp; drop method.\nThe key icon can be used to assign access rights for the roots and groups. The delete function can be used to remove the created roots, groups and participants again.\n"

The alert media must be defined under ADMIN during first-time entry. The system conducts a minimum plausibility check which verifies the permissible formats. After being successfully checked, the alert medium can be added with the respective icon. Every medium gets a standard designation. Media that are classified as “private” are rendered unidentifiable. This privacy functionality must be explicitly enabled under Admin in the registry (“*Privacy Flag*”). [The various alert media are listed in the order in which they were entered. Based on this order, an alert is raised by first alerting the top alert medium and the alert is then forwarded to the next medium. The alert order can be flexibly changed by clicking an alert medium and moving it up or down via the drag \u0026amp; drop method. The active alert media is identified by a checkmark. If you want to set the status of an alert medium to “inactive”, remove the checkmark and the medium is displayed in grey: .\nIn this case, this alert medium is no longer included in the alert.

Enter the required text in the input window of the respective language and confirm your entry by clicking the “Create” button: The text language, which is relevant for converting the text to speech (using the text-to-speech interface), is displayed in front of the created text. The created texts can be listened to via voice output, changed and deleted. The navigation buttons can be used to change the order of the created texts.\nAn alert/message can contain 160 characters. There are approximately ten characters in the GSM alphabet that need two characters, although only one is displayed. This applies to the following special characters: *€ { } [ ~ ] \\* as well as a page break and an ESC\nThe eAlarm counter does not take this into consideration and counts every stroke regardless of whether it needs one or two characters in the GSM alphabet. This can result in a discrepancy between the display and the actual dispatch. We recommend using the characters mentioned above only sporadically. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that they count for two characters. The counter in eAlarm cannot be adjusted, because the same alert text is also used for pagers, e-mail and fax messages for which the GSM alphabet is not relevant.\nPlease pay attention to the information in the lower area of the text editor:\n a time stamp with the format 03Apr2135 (for 3.4. 9:35 p.m.) is inserted into the message text using the placeholder *###dat###*\n A time stamp in the \u0026lsquo;Date-Time-Group\u0026rsquo; format, 032135Apr04 (for 3.4.2004 9:35 p.m.), is inserted into the message text using the placeholder *###dtg###*\n The placeholder *!name!* is replaced by the name of the participant upon dispatch. This makes it possible to use a personal greeting.\n The placeholder *###onum###* communicates the initiator\u0026rsquo;s telephone number to the recipient when an alert is triggered by voice call.\n  \nVoiceoutput option for alert texts You can listen to every text that you have created via the Language menu *[Language menu]*. You can upload audio files in Windows wave format (*.wav) in the Language menu. If you cannot upload audio files, you can alternatively call the phone number 058 252 76 76 and read your free text aloud. After dialling, you will be asked for your PIN which you can find in the Language menu. The PIN becomes invalid after 5 minutes.\n"

In eAlarm emergency, your company structure is represented by so called \u0026lsquo;Roots\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Groups\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Participants\u0026rsquo;. which are hierarchically orderd and freely configurable.\n Creation of the higher-level roots for high ranking units, such as divisions or corporate departments\n Creation of groups, which are sub-categories of the roots. A root can have multiple groups and one group can be assigned to multiple roots or even other groups. Groups may represent different teams or operational units.\n Create and add concerning participants with all necessary information.
