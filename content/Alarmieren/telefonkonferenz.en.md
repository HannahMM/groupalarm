Replace an existing telephone number with a new number.

The conference participants required are listed separately. All
communication media capable of taking part in conferences (mobile and
fixed-line numbers) are displayed for every participant. The checkboxes
for the alert resource defined as “conference medium” for the
participant are preselected by default and can be disabled, if
necessary. Resources which have not been selected can be selected using
the checkboxes, if necessary. Multiple conference resources can
therefore be called at the same time for each participant.

Other people can be added to the participant list with the
“**Subscriber**” quick start function. The subjects can be dragged &
dropped from the subscriber list to the alert subscriber column.

The duration of the conference can be defined on the last tab. The
conference is started by clicking the “**start conference**” button.
