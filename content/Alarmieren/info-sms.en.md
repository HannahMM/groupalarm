### Info SMS 

View the Info SMS screen by clicking the “Quick-Launch” button
![](/img/info_sms_eng.png?classes=shadow)
or via the **“Alerting”** tab.
When messages are sent via the “Info SMS” function, it is not possible
for the participants to make an acknowledgement. Therefore, the “Status”
menu does not provide any feedback on the Info SMS dispatch. Unlike the
SMSprio alert, the Info SMS is treated like a normal SMS.

If participants or a group is selected in the column view of the Alert
screen, the Info SMS icon is active and can be selected. Enter an info
text and determine the sending time (immediately or prospectively). Use
three ways to add further participants in addition to the have already
been selected:

- **Direct**: enter the mobile number of another participant

- **Name**: enter the name of another participant

- **Edit** alert list: when clicking “edit”, the “Alert” screen with
    column view appears, in which the groups and participants can be
    added or removed

**Caution!** The info text is not saved, for instance by adding
participants and groups via “Edit alert list”, the text will be lost.
Workaround: Copy and save the text in a Word file. The copy/paste
function can be used in **eAlarm**'s text fields.

Once an info text has been entered, the “Send info” box (bottom right)
is appears in
red: ![](/img/info_versenden_en.png?classes=shadow)
Sending the info SMS to the selected participants can now be triggered.
