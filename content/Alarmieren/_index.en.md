The “Alerting” tab offers three sub-categories **Alert**, **Info SMS**
and **Telephone Conference**, to trigger alerts.

Depending on the requirements and emergency situation, you can use these
tabs to trigger an **“Alert”**, send an **“Info SMS”** and/or start a
**“Telephone Conference”**. As start page, the **“Create alert”**
appears after you successfully log into **eAlarm emergency**.

Roots, groups, participants, templates, etc. can be listed in the
various independent columns. These column settings can be changed by the
user itself. The number of columns appearing in the “Alert screen” can
be changed in the admin area.

Transferring individual participants, groups and/or roots from the
columns to the *alert list* (red column at the right-hand edge of the
screen) can be set by drag & drop, double-clicking or with the “Select
choice” button. If the entire root is added to the alert list, all
participants, groups and sub-groups of the root are also added at the
same time.
