### Substitutions for TTS

TTS stands for text-to-speech (automatic conversion from written text to
speech). Cases can be defined here where the written form of words is
different from how they are pronounced. eAlarm itself is an example.
“eAlarm” is pronounced \[E-alarm\]. In addition, the user can define all
abbreviations here that are spoken in full during a voice alert
transmission.
