### Change the permanent media designations

A standard designation must be defined here for every medium to be
entered. One of the suggested media (SMS, phone call, etc.) is selected
from the list and a short, explanatory description provided.

The designations defined here are the clearly defined media designations
and can be assigned to “Alert media” under “Changes” when entering alert
media.
