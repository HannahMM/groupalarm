### Deployement plans

In addition to the scheduling options, the new deployment plans can be
used as an alternative for deployment and rotation planning. One of the
two options must be chosen; they cannot be used in parallel. The
deployment plans are defined in the admin area; i.e. deployment times
are determined on the basis of day/night, weekdays and public holidays,
calendar weeks and months.

One or more deployment plans can then be assigned to a group via group
settings, and this produces copies for the respective groups with the
corresponding deployment plan. The group can subsequently be included in
the alert with or without the deployment plan, as is necessary.
