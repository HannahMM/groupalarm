### Password

The password can be changed here. To protect your data against
unauthorised access more effectively in eAlarm emergency, minimum
requirements are set for your passwords. Minimum requirements for the
password strength:

-   

    At least 8 characters

    

-   

    At least 1 upper case, 1 lower case letter and 1 digit

    

-   

    No sequences or duplicates (e.g. 1234, dcba, 5555)

    

**COMMENT:** There are still no restrictions in place as regards for how
long passwords are in place in eAlarm. However, we recommend that our
customers regularly change their password (approx. every three-six
months) for security reasons.
