### Trigger PIN 


The trigger PIN is a 4-digit number. The PIN can be freely defined and
can occur multiple times in the system. The participant can use the PIN
to trigger an alert by SMS in combination with a trigger authorisation
number.

### Trigger authorisation numbers 

The **\[edit\]** link takes the user to a list with the numbers that
have trigger authorisation for the account. A new number can be
authorised with the following parameters under **“New entry”:**

-   

    Number: sender number of the authorised end device. The format has
    to be exactly the same as the format indicated; make sure to pay
    attention to the format information.

    

-   

    Name: name of the participant with trigger authorisation. The name
    is only used to make the list of those trigger authorisation easier
    to read.

### Telephone authorisation with Syspin 
 

Instead of authorising the sender's number, it is also possible to
identify the user via Syspin when the alert is triggered by phone in the
DTMF menu. If the **“Telephone authorisation with Syspin XXXXXX”**
checkbox is enabled, this makes it possible to trigger alerts from any
telephone line. This requires the user to know the 6-digit Syspin which
has to be entered in the language menu.

The Syspin is a globally unique number and is predefined by eAlarm
emergency. It ensures that a caller can be assigned to the correct
customer account. As additional security, the 4-digit trigger PIN is
also requested when authorisation is carried out via the Syspin.

**COMMENT:** the Syspin is predefined and cannot be selected by the
customer.
