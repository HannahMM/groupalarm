### Weekly planner

In the weekly planner, it is possible to define the respective media
cascade for each time profile on the basis of the medium designation.
This happens by enabling or disabling the desired media for each
profile. They can be organised into the order required using the
drop-down menu. If necessary, all of the media can be triggered
simultaneously. In this section, up to ten weekly planners can be
created, each with up to four time profiles. One of the ten weekly
planners can be set as the “default” and assumes the role of the default
weekly planner when creating and importing participants. The predefined
weekly planners can be applied to individual existing participants or to
entire groups of existing participants. The weekly planners can now also
be applied for specific alerts.
