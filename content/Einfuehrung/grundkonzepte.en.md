For an easier start with **eAlarm emergency** and to ensure an effective alerting process, we would advise you to outline a basic 
scheme of your company structure. 
You may ask yourself the following questions:

 - Which organisational/operational units exist and what is their hierarchy?
 - What alerting scenarios do you expect and what is the following course of events?
 - Which User should get administrative rights, who should be allowed to alert, mutate, administrate?
 
 
In **eAlarm emergency**, your company structure is represented by so called *'Roots', 'Groups'* and *'Participants'*.
which are hierarchically orderd and freely configurable.

1. Creation of the higher-level roots for high ranking units, such as divisions or corporate departments

2. Creation of groups, which are sub-categories of the roots. A root can have multiple groups and one group can be 
assigned to multiple roots or even other groups. Groups may represent different teams or operational units.

3. Create and add concerning participants with all necessary information. Participants can belong to more than one group and/or
root.

You can easily modify and amend your structure at all times. Take your time to model a sensible reference of your corporate
structures.
