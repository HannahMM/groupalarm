All conference participants are displayed in this screen. In addition to
the telephone numbers identified as conference media, other
communication media/telephone numbers are displayed for all
participants. The conference initiator can therefore still change the
conference medium. Multiple conference media can be selected at the same
time. In addition, the conference initiator must specify the telephone
number with which the call will be lead. The conference can be started
immediately or scheduled for a later time.
