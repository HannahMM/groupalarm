As with ongoing alerts, an ongoing conference can be accessed via menu
“Status” – “*Conference status*” – “**active conferences**”. If several
conferences are active at the same time, one must be selected for
viewing. During ongoing conferences, initiators can:

- Add a subscriber by entering a number 

- ![](/img/xrot_en.png)Exclude
    subscriber from the conference by clicking the red X

- ![](/img/mutesymbol_en.png)Mute
    (subscriber can then only listen but are themselves not heard) and
    unmute subscriber

- Close the conference
