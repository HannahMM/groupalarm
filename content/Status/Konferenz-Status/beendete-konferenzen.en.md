All conferences are listed consecutively in an endless list. As is the
case with the subscriber list, it is also possible to search for
specific conferences using the filter menu.

Once the conference has come to an end, a protocol is saved under
**“closed conferences”** in the “*Status*” menu. The entire conference
process is summarised in various reports, which can subsequently be sent
via e-mail.

The table shows the following from left to right:

- **Conference**: is the conference number

- **Dispatcher**: who triggered it?

- **Scheduled**: for when was the conference scheduled?

- **Started**: when did the conference start?

- **Closed**: when did the conference end?

- **Function**: available functions and reports for the
    respective conference.
