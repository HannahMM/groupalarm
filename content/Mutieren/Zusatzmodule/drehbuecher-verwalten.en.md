### Manage alert scenarios 
 

In so-called scenarios, multiple alert and conference templates can be
arranged successively on a timeline. This way, if an alert has not ended
after a certain, predefined amount of time, the next alert/conference
template is triggered automatically. This allows automatic alert
escalations to be predefined, which otherwise would have to be done
manually.  

Alert templates are created in the first step (see previous chapter
“Manage alert templates”). Once the alert templates (or conference
templates) have been made, a scenario can be created. The scenarios are
saved under a freely definable name and given a customer-specific
trigger code that is particularly important for remote triggering.

Click on “Manage alert scenarios”. Create a new scenario
( ![](/img/newscenariao.png))
or manage an existing scenario by clicking on the blue
![](/img/blaues_bearbeitungsicon_en.png) edit icon.

In this example, we are selecting a new scenario. You are taken directly
to the “General” tab.

### General 
 
A trigger code appears at the top of the screen. Either leave it as it
is or change it to any another code. Give the script a name and describe
it in more detail if you wish.

### Template assignement 
 

 ![](/img/tempateassignement.d9a0ec384a2ea0cf76f5dfa6863d92f6.png)

You can add any templates that are available under “Attributable
templates”.

Select one or several templates you require and then click on “add”.

As soon as you have added a number of templates, they will be listed and
displayed in a grey frame. The first template always starts at 0 time
(can be overridden). You can move the individual templates using drag &
drop and in this way change their sequence. This is also possible under
“*Simulation view Timeline*”. You can also set the time delay in the
same way. Click on “save scenario” to save your changes.

### Texts 
 
When making a change, you can set a global freely definable text. Or,
you can also choose the text from each template.

<a name="copy_scenario"></a>
### Copy scenario 
 

You can easily copy an existing scenario. During the copying process,
all of the data sets are also copied. To do this, click the copy icon.

Once you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of the scenario is created.
The system names it “copy 1”.

<a name="lock_scenario"></a>
### Lock scenario 
 
The scenario can be locked via the
 ![](/img/schloesschen_fr.png)
icon. This prevents an unauthorised person from editing or deleting the
scenario. Only the author or super user can unlock the scenario.
