### Import/Export

In addition to the participant data, the import makes it possible to
also import the optional fields, the units and their hierarchical
structure. The import is primarily designed for manual “first import”.

**Updating via import:** every data set contains a unique key (ID) that
may only be issued once per customer. If the ID already exists in the
database, the respective data is overwritten with the new data; an
update is therefore carried out.

The following section describes the process for the “first import”; the
process remains the same, however, for updates and “post-imports”.
