### Manage conference templates 

The user can create and manage conference templates in this sub-menu.
There are different ways to create a conference template:

1.  via the “***List of subscriber***”

2.  via “***Manage conference templates***”

### Create New Conference Template

Choose the target people from the alerting screen by adding the
participants to the alert participant column via the drag & drop method.
A conference template can be created or updated using this method:

1.  **Add initiator to the conference**: the conference initiator is
    then included in the telephone conference. This, however, is not
    possible once the conference is triggered, e.g. by weblink.

    

2.  **First Responder” conference**: all of the participants included
    in the conference template are called. The conference, however, only
    takes place with the *first* person to accept the call. All other
    participants receive a cancellation notice.

    

Conference templates are saved under a freely definable name and given a
customer-specific trigger code that is particularly important for remote
triggering.

**NOTE** The trigger code is all that is required to trigger a
conference template, because this template does not need alert texts.

**IMPORTANT** The trigger codes for each unit are independent of one
another, i.e. trigger code 1 can occur up to three times: once for an
alert template, once for a scenario and once for a conference template.
The code only has to be unique within the same unit type which is also
continuously checked by eAlarm emergency. The created conference
templates are saved and listed in a table.

The template can be locked via the

icon. This prevents an unauthorised person from editing or deleting the
template. The conference can still be initiated. Only the author or
super user can unlock the template.
