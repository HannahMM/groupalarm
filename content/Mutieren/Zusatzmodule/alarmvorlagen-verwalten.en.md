### Manage alert templates 



Alert templates are predefined alerts, i.e. the participant group and
the possible alert texts are already predefined. In the event of an
emergency, the predefined alert template can be triggered and the
defined alert participants are sent the alert text via the respective
media.

There are different ways to create an alert template:

### Create a new alert template 



After you click
the ![](/img/create_new_template_en.png)
button in the “**Manage alert templates**” sub-menu, you are taken to
previously seen screens. A template is created here which contains a
trigger code, an authorised initiator, an alert name, a description and
a text.

Alert templates are saved under a freely definable name and given a
customer-specific trigger code that is particularly important for remote
triggering.

One text can be defined as the default from among all of the texts
available; the others are displayed as alternative texts. Using the
Radio button
![](/img/blauerpunkt_en.png),
the user can decide on a default text which can also be entered as a
free text. The user ticks the checkboxes
![](/img/checkbox_en.png)
to select the alternative texts that shall be on the short list when an
alert is triggered:

In the example above, the “*Dies ist ein TEST*” text is defined as the
default text. Six alternative texts are selected at the same time. If
you now want to trigger this alert template, you will see six texts that
can be selected under the defined texts and the preselected text “*Dies
ist ein TEST*”:

If the alert is triggered without changes, the alert is sent to the
participants with the “Dies ist ein TEST” text. It is possible to edit
the text (by pressing the \*\[QuickEdit\]\* button), select a defined
text from the preselected texts or write a new text by clicking the
Radio button next to the free
text.![](/img/frei_text_en.png)

Users with the “*E-Mail/Fax*” module enabled, which allows alerts to be
sent to the e-mail and fax target media, can attach PDF documents to the
text message. This means that, in the event of an alert, additional
detailed information can be sent to fax and e-mail recipients as an
attachment, if required. The corresponding links are available under the
text fields. One document can be attached for each language. The user
can define the number of text fields by enabling the “Show Languages”
function in the *Registry* under **Admin.**

There are three termination criteria available for the alert in the
“**Alert options**” sub-menu: after X% positive acknowledgements, i.e.
yes answers, after X positive acknowledgements and X minutes after alert
was started.

The template can be locked via the
 ![](/img/schloss_en.png)
icon. All of the alert templates created are saved and listed in a table
under “Manage alert templates”.

This prevents an unauthorised person from editing or deleting the
template. The alert can still be triggered. Only the author or super
user can unlock the template.

### Copying alert templates 




You can easily copy existing alert templates. During the copying
process, all of the data sets are also copied. To do this, click the
Copy icon.
 ![](/img/alarmvorlage_copy_en.b29e368ca3dceed6c93e845e8fefb765.png)

Once you have clicked the copy icon, a copy of your alert template is
created. The system names it “copy 1”.
