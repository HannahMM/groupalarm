Enter and manage your alert and mobilisation structure in the
**“Mutation”** menu. The organisational structure are going to be mapped
here according to the needs.

Create and manage the structure of the alert organisation in
**“Organisational Chart / Tree view”**. This includes creating and
editing roots and groups as well as allocating participants to the
roots/groups. New participants can be entered, changed or deleted along
with all of their entries, e.g. alert media, under **“List of
subscribers”**. In addition, individual alert texts can be defined,
which can then be used and managed later as text template, in the
“Mutation” menu **“Texts”**.

Before starting roots creation, groups and subscriber list, it is
recommend to first outline the alert and mobilisation structure to be
mapped and reviewing whether this meets requirements.

Further information on the individual change chapters is available in
the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the respective chapter.
