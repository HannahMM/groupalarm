### Organisational chart / Tree view 

You can see which actions are possible in the right-hand taskbar under
“*Available*”. You can create and add new scenarios, alert templates,
conference templates, Folders (Groups), schedules and/or users
(subscribers).

<a name="roots"></a>
### Roots 

To create a new root, enter the name of the new root in the input field
and confirm by clicking the “Create”
button. ![](/img/neue_wurzel_en.png)

The created root is listed immediately in the display field. If the name
chosen is already assigned, a warning message appears indicating this.
You can add a name, contact and addresses to the newly created root by
clicking the edit icon
![](/img/blaues_bearbeitungsicon_en.png).


<a name="group"></a>
### Group 

A new group can be created via the right-hand display window. Select a
“**New folder**” for the group from the available selection options,
enter the name of the group and confirm creation of the new group by
pressing the “Enter” button.

Once the group has been created, it is listed in the lower display
field. It is also possible to edit the new group further via the edit
icon ![](/img/blaues_bearbeitungsicon_en.png)
and, as with the root, add detailed information such as name, contact
and address. Although the delete
function ![](/img/xrot_en.png)
permanently deletes the created groups, the participants are retained
and only the assignment to this group is eliminated.


<a name="subscriber"></a>
### Subscriber 

Similar to groups, new participants can also be created using the “**New
user**” command in the selection options.

Once the roots, groups and participants are entered, they must be
organised into a specific structure. The hierarchical structure of the
various organisational units is crucial for the alert.

A *root* represents the highest hierarchical level that one or more
groups can be assigned to. The *group* itself can also, in turn, contain
one or more groups. One or more *participants* can be assigned to a
group. A group and a participant can also be present multiple times in
the organisational structure. The group and the participant can be
assigned to a root/group using the drag & drop method.

![](/img/wurzelhirarchie_en.png)
The key icon
![](/img/key_en.png)
can be used to assign access rights for the roots and groups. The delete
function
![](/img/xrot_en.png)
can be used to remove the created roots, groups and participants again.
