### List of subscribers 

All participants are listed in the *list of subscribers*. You can search
for participants here by entering a keyword based on various parameters,
e.g. by surname, street, city and other parameters (“apply filter”).

![](/img/teilnehmer_filter_en.eb129d02caf811d1b253cdc655e40d17.png?width=700px&classes=shadow)


You can also define new sorting criteria in the **ADMIN** menu under
“**Data fields**”. If the number of defined criteria is too high,
resulting in there no longer being enough space on a line, the view can
be optimised. To do this, click the triangle symbol on the drop-down
menu for the sorting criteria at the bottom right and delete the
irrelevant criterion from the display line.

![](/img/filterfunktion_bei_teilnehmer_en.f5dcdb11f538b74cdd93ecad3b511d6f.png)
This can be added again at a later time by clicking the triangle symbol
on the drop-down menu for the last icon of the line and selecting the
missing criteria from the drop-down menu.

width="700"}](../neues_filter_en.png_en_ea_teilnehmerliste.en.md "en:neues_filter_en.png")
The order of the criteria can be defined in the drop-down menu by
deleting unimportant criteria and sorting important criteria by
priority. Individual participants can be transferred from the
participant list to the right-hand column using the drag & drop method
(or by double-clicking).
![](/img/teilnehmer_drag_2.0_en.png)
In this column, you can:

- Enter and add a subscriber to a new group

- Add a subscriber to an existing group

- Create a new alert template

- Update an existing alert template

- Create a new conference template

- Update an existing conference template

- Delete a subscriber
    

New subscriber can also be entered in the list of subscribers. When the
“**New subscriber**” button is pressed, the subscriber Zone opens. This
is where personal data can be
entered: ![](/img/neuer_teilnehmer_en.png).
The edit icon
![](/img/blaues_bearbeitungsicon_en.png)
can be used to edit all subscriber that have already been entered in the
subscriber zone at any time.


<a name="subscriber_zone"></a>
### Subscriber Zone 

All of a subscriber's relevant and informative properties and attributes
can be added and edited in the participant area.
![](/img/teilnehmerbereich_en.png)

- **General**

A participant's contact data can be entered in the general section. The
participant's login and PIN do not have to be defined because they are
automatically assigned by the system.

- **Optional**

Other criteria can be added in the optional section (e.g. department,
function, training) which facilitate, e.g. the search for target people
or their groups in accordance with these criteria. The optional fields
can be created so that they apply to all accounts in the “Data fields”
menu under ADMIN.

- **Alert medium**

The alert media are defined in the alert medium section by selecting the
alert medium in the drop-down menu and completing the respective number
(or address). The alert media must be defined under ADMIN during
first-time entry. The system conducts a minimum plausibility check which
verifies the permissible formats. After being successfully checked, the
alert medium can be added with the respective icon. Every medium gets a
standard designation. Media that are classified as “private” are
rendered unidentifiable. This privacy functionality must be explicitly
enabled under Admin in the registry (“*Privacy Flag*”).
[![](../teilnehmerbreich_alarmmittel_en.f374c1c36f693b19ef18298e241b52ea.png)
The various alert media are listed in the order in which they were
entered. Based on this order, an alert is raised by first alerting the
top alert medium and the alert is then forwarded to the next medium. The
alert order can be flexibly changed by clicking an alert medium and
moving it up or down via the drag & drop method. The active alert media
is identified by a checkmark. If you want to set the status of an alert
medium to “inactive”, remove the checkmark and the medium is displayed
in
grey: ![](/img/graue_box_en.png).

In this case, this alert medium is no longer included in the alert. If
you want a *parallel* alert, i.e. all alert media of a participant are
alerted simultaneously, set the checkmark in the “*Parallel alert***Bold
Text**”
field: ![](/img/paralell_alarmierung_en.png).

**IMPORTANT:** when entering a new number, e-mail address, etc., you
have to click “**add**”!
![](/img/wichtigkeit_des_hinzufuegens_2.0_en.5ce3779955733e0cadc76445b22eddd1.png)
Once you have added it successfully, you still have to set a
checkmark ![](/img/haeckchen_en.png) 
for the alert medium.
![](/img/alarmittel_loeschen_und_bearbeiten_en.b333e0a8589e231fcff503887c430262.png?width=700px&classes=shadow)
To edit the alert medium, click the edit
icon ![](/img/blaues_bearbeitungsicon_en.png);
To delete the alert medium, click the delete
icon ![](/img/xrot_en.png).

### Copying subscribers 

You can easily copy existing participants. When doing this, all data

![](/img/teilnehmer_kopieren_en.55d4e79b72b0c14fc80cda0c3aa2d36d.png?width=700px&classes=shadow)

<a name="subscribers_in_groups"></a>
### Subscribers in groups 

You can assign the groups directly from the subscriber level. The groups
can be assigned directly when changing the participants. There is a
“*Groups*” tab for this purpose that shows all the groups available to
this participant. On the left, you can see all the available and
assignable groups, on the right, all the already assigned groups, which
can be filed away again.

Click on the tab “Mutation”.

Then on “List of subscribers”.

Then click on **“Groups”.**

![](/img/hansmustergruppe_en.df2568463f27bde60547a92361cf5c05.png?width=700px&classes=shadow)

On the left, you can see the groups that are available, and on the
right, the group in which the participant is already a member.

![](/img/verfuegbare_gruppe_en.26eec3646c313a4b3545a39fa12bcc0b.png?width=700px&classes=shadow)

by holding down the Ctrl or Shift keys.
