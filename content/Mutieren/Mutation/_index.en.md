Goal is to create the alert trigger to be as simple and clear as
possible. As a result, the alert organisation should also have a simple
structure in order to ensure that the alert can be triggered as
efficiently as possible in an emergency. Meaning the alert structure
does not absolutely have to follow the organisational structure, but can
be chosen according to the alert type or other criteria. The following
section describes the “Organisational chart/Tree view”, “Participant
list” and “Texts” functions in detail.
