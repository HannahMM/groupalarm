### Texts

Predefined alert texts can be written in four languages (German,
English, French and Italian) using eAlarm emergency. The text editor
required to create and edit these texts can be found in the “Texts”
sub-menu. Enter the required text in the input window of the respective
language and confirm your entry by clicking the “Create” button:

The text language, which is relevant for converting the text to speech
(using the text-to-speech interface), is displayed in front of the
created text. The created texts can be listened to via voice output,
changed and deleted. The navigation buttons can be used to change the
order of the created texts.

An alert/message can contain 160 characters. There are approximately ten
characters in the GSM alphabet that need two characters, although only
one is displayed. This applies to the following special characters:
**€ { } \[ \~ \] \\** as well as a **page break** and an **ESC**

The eAlarm counter does not take this into consideration and counts
every stroke regardless of whether it needs one or two characters in the
GSM alphabet. This can result in a discrepancy between the display and
the actual dispatch. We recommend using the characters mentioned above
only sporadically. Don't forget that they count for two characters. The
counter in eAlarm cannot be adjusted, because the same alert text is
also used for pagers, e-mail and fax messages for which the GSM alphabet
is not relevant.

Please pay attention to the information in the lower area of the text
editor:

-   a time stamp with the format 03Apr2135 (for 3.4. 9:35 p.m.) is
    inserted into the message text using the placeholder
    \*\#\#\#dat\#\#\#\*

    

-   A time stamp in the 'Date-Time-Group' format, 032135Apr04 (for
    3.4.2004 9:35 p.m.), is inserted into the message text using the
    placeholder \*\#\#\#dtg\#\#\#\*

    

-   The placeholder \*!name!\* is replaced by the name of the
    participant upon dispatch. This makes it possible to use a
    personal greeting.

    

-   The placeholder \*\#\#\#onum\#\#\#\* communicates the initiator's
    telephone number to the recipient when an alert is triggered by
    voice call.

### Voiceoutput option for alert texts 




You can listen to every text that you have created via the Language menu
\*\[Language menu\]\*. You can upload audio files in Windows wave format
(*\*.wav*) in the Language menu. If you cannot upload audio files, you
can alternatively call the phone number 058 252 76 76 and read your free
text aloud. After dialling, you will be asked for your PIN which you can
find in the Language menu. The PIN becomes invalid after 5 minutes.
